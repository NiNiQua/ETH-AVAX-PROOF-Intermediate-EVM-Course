# Project Title

MetaHouse Contract, A Simple Smart Contract for Managing Presence in a Virtual Home. 

## Description

This project is a simple smart contract that implements the require(), assert(), and revert() statements. This project is a simple smart contract built using Solidity, which allows a land owner to manage their presence in a virtual house (MetaHouse). The contract provides functions for the land owner to enter and leave the MetaHouse, as well as check their presence status.

The Smart Contract as the following features:
First the Enter and Leave feature where the land owner can enter and leave the MetaHouse by calling the enter and leave functions. As well as a Presence Status, where the land owner can check their presence stuatus by calling the isPresent function. 

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Follow these steps:

### Installing

To get stated with the project, you'll need too have Remix open it is a web-based Solidity IDE that allows the user to write, deploy, andd test smart contracts.
- Open Remix in your web browser: https://remix.ethereum.org/
- Create a new Solidity file by clicking on the "Create" button.
- Copy and paste the contract code into the new file.

Instead of copying and pasting the contract code, you can also import it directly.
- Download the file and click "Open a File from your File System" to import the contract code into Remix.
  
Once you've importeed the contract code, you can proceed with compiling and deploying the contract.

### Executing program

To deploy and interact with the contract, follow these steps:

Compile the contract by clicking on the "Compile" button in the Remix Solidity compiler.
Deploying the contract to the Remix VM by clicking on the "Deploy" button.
Interact with the contract using the Remix console.
